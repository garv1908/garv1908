## hey, i’m garv!

i’m a software engineer who loves building things and understanding how systems work under the hood. i’m especially drawn to **backend engineering** — designing APIs, working with data, and making things scale.

i’ve been to **~15 hackathons**, won **3**, and even helped organize one with my team at **Google Developer Group @ TMU**. i really enjoy taking an idea and breaking it down to build it back up - cleanly :)

some hackathons i've won:
- [NetNanny](https://github.com/ShelmahChebet/NetNanny) - a browser extention that alerts parents when a kid is communicating with a suspicious person online
- [DigiTag](https://github.com/garv1908/digitag) - a way to track ownership of high-end assets with NFTs
- [SolarScope](https://github.com/daniel04wawng/SolarScope) - used AR glasses and a light sensor to view non-traditional architecture and calculated energy output if building was covered in solar panels

### what i’m up to right now
- cs @ tmu, graduating april/may 2026
- looking for full-time SWE roles! (backend-leaning)
- currently building [orbit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCiL6ExIMPZWcjah5LiL0_F3qIca2Re_2qyo_8_nh-U/edit?usp=sharing)!

### a bit about me
- i’m curious, intentional, and genuinely enjoy learning new things  
- i like pushing myself into unfamiliar territory — that’s where i learn best  
- i care a lot about communication.

outside of code, i enjoy:
- good cinema (ask me for my Letterboxd)
- exploring new places & appreciating art
- playing volleyball
- meeting thoughtful, interesting people

---

### things i value
- knowing *how* to learn
- being honest about what i don’t know (yet)
- writing code i’m proud of
- staying genuine, even in professional spaces
